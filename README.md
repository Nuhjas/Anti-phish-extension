  1. URL Analysis:
      - When a user visits a website, PhishScan fetches the URL and analyzes it for various characteristics such as:
          - Length of the URL (too long or too short).
          - Presence of suspicious patterns, such as IP addresses or special characters.
          - Whether the domain uses HTTPS or if there are multiple redirections.
  2. Content Evaluasion:
       - PhishScan checks for specific elements like:
          - Suspicious anchor tags or scripts linking to external domains.
          - Forms that might redirect sensitive information to unknown domains.
          - Presence of "mailto" links and other unusual patterns.
        
  3. Real-Time Notification:

      - Based on the analysis, the extension classifies the website as:
          - Legitimate: Safe to browse.
          - Phishing: Immediately exit the site.
       
      - Notifications are displayed using either:
